# Darwin Database

The aim to this project is to scrap from this [page](http://www.darwin.edu.ar/Proyectos/FloraArgentina/Especies.asp) to obtain a ordered dataframe. The entries are the species wanted and the outupt is the data frame with all the features of each specie. 

First we have to download the list of all species, the web page looks like this

Then we load input.csv wich contains the list of all species wanted. Finally the program will download all requiered information and will write selected features in output.csv.
